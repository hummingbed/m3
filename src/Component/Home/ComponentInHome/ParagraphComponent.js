                                    The Apprenticeship model is as old as human society, predating the emergence of the
                                    first civilization, the coming together of humans to live and work in a city.
                                    What makes the Igbo Apprenticeship System truly special is sheer scale and vital
                                    redistribution – technical, financial, or otherwise. Its strong sub-cultural
                                    identity and practical effects marvels the West.
